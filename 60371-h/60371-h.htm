</p>

<p class="poem">
  As gallant knights, as valiant-souled crusaders,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You come from quests of peril o'er the sea;<br />
  From conflicts stern, against the brute invaders,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With laurels nobly won, you come to me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In contest grim, the mightiest of the ages,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My banner through the carnage you have borne;<br />
  Your names are written large on Glory's pages,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I greet you, gallant soldiers, battle-worn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Through all the years to be, I shall remember<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deeds you wrought, since first you sailed away;<br />
  Since flaming down through Belgium, that September,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prussian hell-hounds, baying, sought Calais.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There Ypres and St. Julien, shining glorious,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Courcelette and Vimy's Ridge aglow,<br />
  And many another unsung fight, victorious,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein you clove a pathway through the foe.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  You have returned with memories unfading,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of prodigies performed in Freedom's name,<br />
  Of charging hosts and volley's enfilading,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And roaring craters curtained with death's flame.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Some come not back; in lands afar they're sleeping.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dies for Freedom fills no nameless grave;<br />
  Their memory enshrined all hearts are keeping,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sleep remembered, all the gallant brave.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yours is the place of honour in the nation;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dares for Right the highest shall command;<br />
  Who pours for Liberty his heart's libation<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall win the grateful tribute of my land.<br />

<h3>
  THE BELGIAN MOTHER<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Hear me, O God, who reignest upon high,<br />
  From blood-bespattered fields hear thou my cry!<br />
  Hear Thou a Belgian mother's fierce appeal,<br />
  Whose torn bosom, 'neath the Prussian heel,<br />
  Crimson and breastless challenges Thy sky,<br />
  Of Christ the merciful demanding why.<br />
  Wherefore the murder of my valiant sons!<br />
  Wherefore the ravage of my little ones?<br />
  Hear me, O Father; Jesus, hear me pray,<br />
  Shall there be reckoning, shall Prussia pay?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Father, to whom I knelt these many years,<br />
  Thou wilt give answer to a mother's tears;<br />
  Give answer to the cry of her despair,<br />
  If heav'n be not o'erthrown, if Thou art there!<br />
  Helpless I stand amid the storm of hate,<br />
  My children slain, my fields made desolate.<br />
  I will not cease from urging till Thou give<br />
  Some sign, some token, that Thy justice live.<br />
  By daytime and by night-time I shall pray.<br />
  For these foul crimes on mine, shall Prussia pay!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For sack of cities, sacrilege of shrines,<br />
  For trampled tombs, a thousand nameless crimes,<br />
  That cry for vengeance unto Heaven's throne,<br />
  Shall he not pay, shall Prussia not atone?<br />
  The dying hands of children grip my heart;<br />
  From vale and upland, and the thronging mart,<br />
  There is no laughter where they used to play;<br />
  They cry unmothered, starved, with faces gray.<br />
  If this be not a hell 'neath devil's sway,<br />
  For all my little ones, shall Prussia pay!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O God of mine, Thy harvest moon still beams,<br />
  Nor hides in horror from such ghastly scenes,<br />
  And Thy great Sun I thought Thy hand might shade,<br />
  And dim the light that gave such carnage aid.<br />
  Red ravage rides across my piteous plain,<br />
  Behold Namur, behold beloved Louvain!<br />
  Temples of Wisdom, prostrate in the dust,<br />
  Trampled and scarred to glut a despot's lust.<br />
  Hast Thou no rod this crowned Ghoul to flay?<br />
  For ruin of Beauty, Lord, shall Prussia pay!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Out from the land that loved them, beggared flung,<br />
  Sons from the loins of olden heroes sprung;<br />
  They whom great Caesar chronicled in praise,<br />
  Shalt Thou leave outcast, doom to evil days?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Shall Belgium's sons, shall this beloved soil,<br />
  Whose very mould is martial, be made spoil?<br />
  Lord of the slain in olden battles, hear!<br />
  Till all I love, till all I hold most dear,<br />
  Till my young hero-king shall find his throne,<br />
  Till Belgians shall again sing songs of home,<br />
  I from amid the ruins, night and day,<br />
  Shall cry to Thee, "O God, make Prussia pay!"<br />

<h3>
  THE BURIAL OF KING EDWARD, THE PEACE-MAKER<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  All day the league long lines have onward marched;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mourn the sad millions round the silent bier,<br />
  Where rests beneath the temple, nobly arched,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form a worldwide people held most dear.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The sombre pageant darkens all the land.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven Kings in mournful grandeur ride,<br />
  Kings of the earth must bow to death's command;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy the Prince who heeds nor builds on pride!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Happy the land, that in such mournful hour<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can through the tears of parting proudly say,<br />
  As we, he wrought each instrument of power<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For good, and o'er his people's hearts held sway.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Shaping his efforts ever toward this end,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That e'en the alien learned to bless his name,<br />
  Healing the wounds red war had made, a friend<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To arts of peace, that is his crowning fame.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Peacemaker, rest among thy kingly sires;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace was thy shrine, and never war's array,<br />
  Nor glories reared on force were thy desires;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy strength was given to shield, and not to slay.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Dead King, thy noblest triumph here is made.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who claims such tribute from a mighty state<br />
  Reigns on; a sceptred king, though in death laid,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dying lives, beloved, immortal, great.<br />

<h3>
  THE CORONATION OF KING GEORGE V<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  AN ODE OF EMPIRE<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Summer with the sun conspiring spreads her tapestry of June,<br />
  Flora, all her glories flaunting, floors thy pathway flower-strewn,<br />
  Hedge and field and rose-crowned wayside blush in beauty all aflame,<br />
  While around thee, radiant ranging, millions give thee Sire, acclaim.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Strike O Bard! thy proudest Paen, singing with a soul on fire;<br />
  Paint, O Master of the canvas! all that grandeur may inspire;<br />
  But thy soaring inspirations broken-winged shall flutter down,<br />
  Swooning in the purpling glory lighting this an Empire's crown.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Proudly moves the purple pageant over mighty London's pave,<br />
  Rank on rank of gorgeous colour, stately moving wave on wave,<br />
  Rank on rank the massing millions roar a welcome that upsoars<br />
  Like the ocean billows breaking stormy round thy Island shores.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Festooned arches, brilliant bunting, scarlet seas<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white-capped with plumes,<br />
  Tossing, surging, rythmic swaying to melodious marching tunes,<br />
  King and prince and jewelled marquis, ermine robe and silken hose,<br />
  Sweeping stately, thousand bannered, on and on the pageant goes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Onward to the culmination of the long day's fevered strain,<br />
  To the happy culmination with its hope of joyful reign,<br />
  To the solemn coronation 'neath Westminster's wondrous pile,<br />
  Treasure house of Britain's glory, loveliest heirloom of her Isle.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sepulchre sublime and mossy; Brooder old what dreams are thine,<br />
  Thou who blessed our monarch's forebears since the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great Confessor's time,<br />
  Thou who holds the dust of princes in thy motherly embrace,<br />
  Who serene through years of tumult watched upgrow a mighty race.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  From thy walls, oh Temple olden, thou hast watched<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the long years through.<br />
  Seen the forest fastness broken, seen thy sons the seas subdue,<br />
  Seen the Saxon hosts embattled to the conquering Norman yield,<br />
  And the hunchback king remorseless die on Bosworth's bloody field.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Seen thy chivalry in squadrons fall in internecine strife,<br />
  And the regal Stuart yielding on the block a royal life,<br />
  Heard the conflict fierce of battle, heard the raging of old wars,<br />
  Seen the victor lift the vanquished and in peace forget their scars.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And by slow regeneration from the things that did degrade,<br />
  Rise upon a new foundation a fair nation nobly made,<br />
  In her hand the touch of freedom, in her soul the newer birth,<br />
  Bent upon the nobler mission, Peace, good-will, to men of earth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thus to nationhood and greatness did Britannia proudly rise,<br />
  Upwards, onwards, ere extending unto wider, broader skies,<br />
  Penetrating lands of darkness, luminous around the world,<br />
  Mothering a hundred races, guarding 'neath her flag unfurled.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Steadfast in her mighty mission, seeking for the greater good,<br />
  Hampered often in her labour, often too misunderstood.<br />
  Giving of her wealth and wisdom, giving birth to nations new,<br />
  Giant sons who name her mother, mighty offspring to her true.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They who sentinel the vastness of an empire's broad domain,<br />
  Greater than the Macedonians, mightier than Rome or Spain,<br />
  Never empire such as Britain's, never one with fewer stains,<br />
  Far extended, many millioned, mantling mountains, seas, and plains.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sire, we thy sons salute thee from thy empire's utmost end;<br />
  This galaxy, thy free nations, to thee heartfelt greetings send;<br />
  May thy reign be long and fruitful 'neath the King of Kings above,<br />
  Olden empires bound by bondage, thine is bound by chains of love.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sovereign companion of the watery main,<br />
  Who chose the ocean as thy boyish bride,<br />
  Who know her passion in the hurricane,<br />
  And love her with a Briton's sea-born pride;<br />
  Far continents and empires hast thou trod<br />
  And saw thy standards in the sunlight stream,<br />
  In every land beneath the dome of God,<br />
  Ere thought of Empire entered in thy dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Wise in the wisdom of the sea art thou<br />
  To gauge the compass and control the helm;<br />
  God give thee grace to guide an Empire now,<br />
  Prince called to kingship o'er a mighty realm;<br />
  For on the summit of eight hundred years<br />
  Amid the menace of these days we stand,<br />
  And crown thee King amid an Empire's cheers&mdash;<br />
  Lord of a Kingdom reaching land on land.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Upon this day uplifted crowned art thou,<br />
  Full orbed and sceptred in thy kingly state,<br />
  The diadem of Empire on thy brow,<br />
  Throned o'er a kingdom proud, surpassing great.<br />
  Thine is the King, the Sceptre, and the Sword&mdash;<br />
  Symbols of power, thine, and thine alone;<br />
  And thine to keep the compact of the Lord&mdash;<br />
  To guide thy people and protect thy throne.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lo, 'tis the awful moment!  On thy head<br />
  The ancient crown of Britain rests&mdash;'Tis done&mdash;<br />
  Above the tombs where sleep the kingly dead<br />
  That reared a Kingdom and an Empire won.<br />
  Glory on glories round thee blaze, and deep<br />
  Within thy people's hearts thou art enthroned;<br />
  Unfearful of the whirlwinds fierce that sweep<br />
  O'er alien monarchs, banished and disowned.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While splendour such as England seldom knew,<br />
  Within a temple ancient and supreme,<br />
  Marshals her grandeur, crimson, gold, and blue,<br />
  In iridescent shadings opaline.<br />
  Glory on glories 'round thee blaze and sweet<br />
  Ambrosial incense rises to the sides,<br />
  While prince and peer and people 'round thee meet,<br />
  'Neath galleries begemmed with Beauty's eyes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While rolls on high the organ's swelling notes,<br />
  Thrilling aloft in jubilees of sound;<br />
  While joyful from a thousand loyal throats&mdash;<br />
  "God Save the King"&mdash;in glad acclaims resound,<br />
  Triumphant blare the bugles on the breeze,<br />
  In crashing cannonades the guns reply&mdash;<br />
  "God Save the King"&mdash;It leaps a hundred seas,<br />
  And million voiced is echoed to the skies!<br />

  THE GREATER CANADA<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Called the great soul of the Westland, "Come unto me, ye who rule,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who would plan for my greatness needs must attend in my school.<br />
  Vast are my dreams of the future, born in my domain afar,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who would labour to build me let them now follow my star."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Into the East went the message, sweeping on clarion clear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady-toned, crisp and compelling, speaking that all men might hear,<br />
  Telling of courage triumphant, of prodigies nobly performed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of barrenness mantled in beauty, of nakedness clothed and adorned.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And he who ruled in the temple laboured and wrought for the good<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the land that reared him to honour, hearkened and understood;<br />

  Then rose the West for his coming, pulsed the warm blood in her veins,<br />

  THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When men shall say who saved the day in years that are to be;<br />
  When veterans back from war's grim track again abide with me;<br />
  When Peace regains her throne and reigns, and silent are the guns,<br />
  I'll think with pride of those who died and say They were my Sons.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I sent them from their peaceful tasks, those strong young sons of mine;<br />
  I saw them swinging down the street, I saw them stand in line.<br />
  My unbronzed of the counting-house, my sun-tanned from the farms,<br />
  I sent them forth, sons of the North, my gallant men-at-arms.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With summer's fading rose they went, I well recall the day;<br />
  The gold was on the maple leaf, the birds were on the spray,<br />
  And through the long white wintertime I waited for the spring<br />
  For word to tell me how they served their country and their King.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And then I heard the tolling bells and saw the flags half-mast.<br />
  Why should I weep in springtime with the long, white winter past?<br />
  And why are all the people stirred and what is it they say?<br />
  My boys have dared, have fought and shared the glory of the fray.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Across the sea, afar from me, they've met the dreaded Huns<br />
  At Langemarck, in Flanders, my gallant northern sons.<br />
  Near Ypres, in the lowlands, three thousand miles away,<br />
  Across the wave, my children brave, have died&mdash;but saved the day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In grim array that April day, entrenched the Allies lay,<br />
  To bar the path of Prussian wrath that fumed to reach Calais;<br />
  And Ypres town, half battered down, they'd sought with longing eyes,<br />
  For they had sworn that very morn to take it as a prize.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And breathing there the battle air beneath the warm sunshine<br />
  From Peschendelle to Policapelle, Canadians held the line;<br />
  Then, sudden as the avalanche that rips the mountain side,<br />
  The battle broke, and through the smoke they met the German tide.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They watched the fume-filled cloud-bank rise and spread its<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stifling rack;<br />
  They saw the Belgian veterans and gallant French fall back;<br />
  They heard them cry, they saw them fly as men by fiends pursued;<br />
  They heard the shout, they saw the rout before that cloud,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hell-brewed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In such a plight, as veterans might have blanched before and failed,<br />
  They stood uncowed with spirits proud and hearts that never quailed.<br />
  Surprised, amazed, a moment dazed, in that tremendous hour,<br />
  Like living rocks they met the shocks of mad Germanic power.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They saw the wide breach wider grow, when men in terror fled;<br />
  They saw the eager foe leap on o'er the dying and the dead;<br />
  And by that foe and through that gap they saw an Empire fall;<br />
  Then, in the breach, to front the foe, they threw their living wall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They threw their living breasts between to stem the German tide,<br />
  My volunteers of Canada&mdash;they fought as vet'rans tried.<br />
  They fought the boast of Wilhelm's host; they met them hand to hand,<br />
  My young men of the counting-house, my ploughboys from the land.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They came from ranches of the West, where plain and mountain call,<br />
  From down east way, by Fundy's Bay, from Don and Montreal;<br />
  Their feet had known the sea-walled street, where ocean<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mists hang gray,<br />
  And one to four, though stricken sore, they kept the foe at bay.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The air rained death by bomb and dart, the earth belched death below<br />
  By shining blade and hand grenade and death by poison slow.<br />
  Three days of hell, with shot and shell, they fought<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'neath moon and sun;<br />
  The Belgian plain was strewn with slain, Canadian and Hun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ye troubadours&mdash;who sing of wars and brave deeds handed down,<br />
  When you will sing how for the King they fought near Ypres town,<br />
  Tell how they fought and nobly wrought like Paladins of old;<br />
  Tell how my sons retook the guns and won their spurs of gold.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And you will tell how Birchall fell as calm as on parade,<br />
  How on they bore amid the roar in that wild charge they made,<br />
  Where Julien's wood in moonlight stood when midnight met the morn.<br />
  Tell how they died, my brave, my pride, on that field battle torn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They went not forth for gain or gold, 'twas not for such they died.<br />
  They fought for right 'gainst armed might that covenants defied.<br />
  Pure was their quest, to serve the best, their banner they unfurled<br />
  For that high plan, the rights of man, the freedom of the world.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The feet that press'd my ample breast, the eyes that loved my pines,<br />
  Will know no more my welcome shore, but still their glory shines.<br />
  Sing, troubadour, let thy song soar, sing with a voice divine<br />
  Of how they saved the day and braved the despot of the Rhine.<br />

  Oh, everywhere the women wait for men "somewhere in France";<br />
  They wait the postman's passing step, they watch with eager glance;<br />
  They watch and wait to know their fate, with anxious hearts in pain,<br />
  The seas are wide and, woe betide, they may not come again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Oh, postman on your daily round, what message do you bring<br />
  From them who fight in foreign lands for country and for king?<br />
  And is it glad or is it sad, that missive's written page,<br />

<p class="poem">
  "Somewhere in France" in nowhere land, there is no mark at all<br />
  To tell them where their dear ones fight or where their<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loved ones fall;<br />
  But this must be in war, you see, and so they bravely wait,<br />
  Some mother in her quiet room, some sweetheart by the gate.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They may not know the bitter truth, they have enough to bear,<br />
  And well it is they may not know the things that happen there.<br />
  God keep the brave across the wave who fight for more than lives,<br />
  And bless them, too, the women true, the sweethearts, mothers, wives.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And yet we know their sacrifice, and know they'd gladly share<br />
  The wounds and pain of those who fight their battles over there.<br />
  'Tis theirs to bear the secret care more deadly than the blow,<br />
  The nameless pain and heavy chains that only women know.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They may not with their loved ones march with brave and buoyant tread,<br />
  They may not close their dying eyes, nor weep above their dead.<br />
  'Tis theirs to give and wait and live, 'tis theirs to love and bear<br />
  The cross for those whose life-blood flows afar in France,&mdash;Somewhere.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And love is such a wondrous thing that when its sacred flame<br />
  Burns in a woman's heart, she learns what language may not name.<br />
  It pales all blooms, it light illumes, the angel's wing outgilds,<br />
  And makes the sod a court of God, and earth to heaven builds.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Touch with such flame the hearts, O God! of waiting women here,<br />
  And may its light leap o'er the land and gleam in every tear<br />
  That women shed for lovers dead, by war's unholy hands,<br />
  And bring surcease of pain, and peace to this and all the lands.<br />

  Moulding from out the waste an ordered world,<br />
  Striding a bronzed Colossus, grim and rude,<br />
  O'er Afric veldt and Egypt's sands, storm-swirled,<br />
  Pressing Imperial-purposed, to his goal;<br />
  Before, his country's high and luminous star,<br />
  He on her altar laid his splendid soul.<br />
  Bequeathed in martyrdom of glorious war.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Beside the Cyprus hills or Nubian sands,<br />
  By Libya's stony, terraced, huge plateau,<br />
  Within the trackless silence, "what commands!"<br />
  Whispered the Sphinx, his ear alone to know.<br />
  What portents shaped the wild sirocco's rage<br />
  Where Memnon tunes across the plain at dawn?<br />
  Saw he the vast armies of the west engage<br />
  In strife stupendous, in those days agone,<br />
  When by the Nile he conquered at Khartoum?<br />
  Saw he unmoved the vision of his doom?<br />

<p class="poem">
  With his high fame and liberty secure,<br />

  The millions surging to his trumpet voice<br />
  Proclaim the triumph that his genius laid.<br />
  Be brave, my England; it is well, rejoice!<br />

  Amid the crumbling nations, battle-strewn,<br />
  Shadowing times, shifting war-duned sands,<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  From Riga southward to the Horn, fierce beats the iron hail,<br />
  Beneath the Pole Star and the Cross, war's Vampire rides the gale.<br />
  Across earth's shaken palisades, the red sirocco blows<br />
  From sand of Suez in the south to Yukon's northern snows.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And who are these who sally forth&mdash;these million doomed to die,<br />
  Where scarred between embattled hordes, the scalped hills bloody lie,<br />
  Sons of the mothers of the world, each sworn to overwhelm<br />
  Legions of men of many climes, from city, farm, and realm.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sons of the mothers of the Earth, who out of love were born,<br />
  Go forth in majesty of health and come back maimed and torn.<br />
  Caught in the whirlpool of the war, all raging, battle-swirled,<br />
  Boiling and reeling, bloody-foamed, labours the frenzied world.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Who dare cry peace where all is strife; Who bid the conflict cease?<br />
  Who dares to kneel beside the crib which thrones the Prince of Peace?<br />
  Behold! it is the Christmas time, the feast of Him divine;<br />
  How shall we stand with stained hands, and worship at His shrine?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  From Verdun's hero-hallowed heights to Belgium's sea-swept dunes,<br />
  The land with shell-ripped bosom lifts His temples, heaped in ruins.<br />
  What gory harvests here are reaped, of human flesh and bone,<br />
  Christ, in thy Christmas time, forgive!  Who shall for these atone?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The Serbian hills lie bleak and bare, their people fled or slain;<br />
  And through the Iron Gate the storm sweeps the Wallachian plain;<br />
  And twice ten thousand thundering guns hurl forth<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their screaming shells,<br />
  Till Europe seems a place accurst with all its flaming hells.<br />

<p class="poem">
  There is no respite on the land&mdash;no safety on the deep,<br />
  Where like a school of famished sharks the gaunt subs vigil keep;<br />
  While overhead, like vultures huge, the pinioned airships fly,<br />
  Wheeling their courses, seeking prey across the glowering sky.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The sky where once His herald glowed, that ushered in His reign,<br />
  The earth which hushed to hear of Peace in sweet, seraphic strain,<br />
  The water which in olden days, storm-tossed, obeyed His will,<br />
  The earth, the waters, and the sky&mdash;His&mdash;now men mould to kill.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Like human gophers burrowing, whole armies sap and mine,<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  The rocket's glare shall greet His eyes, the tumult breaks His rest,<br />
  And He, the King, shall sorrowed cling unto His mother's breast;<br />
  The battle's smoke His star shall dim, the song the angels sing<br />
  Shall pass unheard; thus men at war shall greet their Lord and King.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What of the future and mankind while Christian, Christian slays?<br />
  How shall we dream of better things amid these saddened days?<br />
  There sounds, derisive, from the East, the laughing Pagan lands,<br />
  "Go back, false prophets of the Christ, with blood upon your hands."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Behind their Eastern barriers as tigers wait their prey,<br />
  The little bead-eyed yellow men sit dreaming of their Day,<br />

<h3>
  GRIT AND TORY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The petty feuds of life depart when roll the Nation's drums,<br />
  And common dangers shared remolds, and strength from union comes.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lived divided in our town,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He up the street where I lived down,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we met we used to frown,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we were Grit and Tory.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was in the yesterdays;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then something came to change our ways;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll tell for you the story.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I used to think I hated him, I felt he hated me,<br />
  Before the Call of Duty came and took us o'er the sea,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I was Grit unto the core,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was Tory double-bore;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In three campaigns we fought it o'er,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In battles sometimes gory.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For prejudice is rooted deep,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And folk sometimes lose precious sleep,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they're Grit and Tory.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It used to be our loudest boast and proudest to relate,<br />
  That we were always party men and always voted straight;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he who holds his cause as right,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is seldom too darn proud to fight,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we fought with all our might<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like two common bruisers;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was in the olden days,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'er something came to change our ways,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make us saner hoosiers.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Full sudden came the King's appeal, a call for volunteers,<br />
  That stirred the fighting blood of us who rowed for many years;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Bill enlisted and I too,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there was fighting still to do,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went o'er the ocean wide and blue,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convoyed by fighting cruisers;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as we sailed for sunny France<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wondered which would get his chance<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And which would be the loser.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When whole battalions march away and enter in the fray,<br />
  The little strifes of little towns seem very far away,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the hasty words that's said<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem petty where great armies tread,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fields are covered thick with dead,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stricken comrades dying;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oft I wondered what I'd say<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bill and I should meet some day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the wounded lying.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Strange tricks that jade of fortune plays upon the field of strife,<br />
  And so it came in war's great game I owed to Bill my life.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We didn't meet till on the Somme&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In No-Man's Land I lay most gone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While over head the bright sun shone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shrapnel shells were flying.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly I felt a thrill.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the voice of fighting Bill<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his old foeman calling.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I did my best to cry hello; it was too great a strain;<br />
  But in a haze I saw his face and heard him call again.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew him by the broken nose<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave him once when we'd had blows<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one of our big country shows,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I gave him a mauling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he spied me and cried&mdash;Joe!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised to greet him kind of slow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he caught me falling.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Such things as this don't happen much, but they do happen though,<br />
  And he's a different Bill to-day and I'm a different Joe.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're back again in that same town.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He up the street where I live down,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we meet, we <i>never</i> frown,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we're still Grit and Tory.<br />

  Within the fields the harvesters were singing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When plentitude and peace were there.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard the bells of Belgium softly chiming,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When o'er the peaceful vale uprose the moon;<br />
  The maiden walked, her lover's arm entwining,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unthinking of his exile, or her doom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard the bells of Belgium sadly tolling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sobbed across the vineyards and the dunes,<br />
  The rack of war across the land was rolling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ravagers had laid the land in ruins.<br />

<p class="poem">
  An alien race a land of freemen goaded,<br />

<p class="poem">

<p class="poem">
  And joy again shall gladden tearful faces,<br />

<p class="poem">
  As towers the mountain o'er the valleys wide,<br />

  THE AVIATORS
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Theirs is the free unrutted tracts of air,<br />
  The clime of cloudland and of boundless space;<br />
  From grimy earth they soar to regions rare,<br />

  Above the clouds; the earth, a swallowed ball.<br />
  Lost in the gray abysses far below;<br />
  Biding the storm above the whirlwinds thrall,<br />
  The Aviators of the Allies go.<br />
  Theirs is the flight of eagles, and as they,<br />
  They swoop and drive their talons in the foe,<br />
  Then wheeling, strike again their crippled prey,<br />
  And send him crashing to the earth below.<br />

  HELL'S ACOLYTE<br />

<p class="poem">
  O'er a city Saturnalian, when the feast was at its height,<br />
  Cried the demon of the riot, riding on the howling night.<br />
  Cried aloud in gleeful frenzy, "Who would wish to be divine,<br />
  When as fiend he reigns the master of unnumbered slaves of wine?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Swept he o'er the noisome brothel where the Bacchanalians brawled,<br />
  Mingled with its maudlin wantons where with libertines they sprawled;<br />
  Hovered o'er the wine-room's riot where his dupes carnival held,<br />
  While the ribald song's wild chorus on the night's mad frenzy swelled.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Gloated as he perched above them, and his voice rang out in pride&mdash;<br />
  "Oh, my master!  I have triumphed, I, thy fiend of drink," he cried.<br />
  "Master thou whose cause I cherish, Master thou who reign'st in hell,<br />
  Am I worthy of thy kinship?  In thy cause have I done well?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Fiend of drink am I, remorseless, ruling, worshipped everywhere&mdash;<br />
  Boon companion of the novice, prop of every wreck's despair.<br />
  Moods have I to meet the many, costumes fit for any state,<br />
  To the brutalized or polished I can be a fitting mate.<br />

<p class="poem">
  "Where patrician faces gather, clothed am I in bright champagne,<br />
  Sparkling gloriously golden, beading to an amorous strain.<br />
  Eyes grow bright as lips caress me; fevers burn within the veins;<br />
  I repay their love with madness, laughing as I forge their chains.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Now, in ruby robes translucent, dance I in the goblet bright,&mdash;<br />
  Wanton of the wine-glass, weaving dreams with mirages bedight.<br />
  O'er the wastes of wine I lure men, till on sands of quenchless thirst,<br />
  Lo, my red simoom engulfs them, helpless, raving, and accurst!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Ere the sun-god, swiftly rising, swings his flaming sword of day,<br />
  Gin-gowned for the assignation, wait I for my quivering prey,&mdash;<br />
  Wait I for my faithful lovers, they who crave my morning kiss,<br />
  Abject, pleading for my favour, for my warmth, reviving bliss.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Sweet to me their hast'ning footsteps at the well-remembered hour,<br />

<p class="poem">
  "Ne'er was queen of story olden wooed as I by mortal man;<br />

  "What a court is this, my master!  Here I watch life's strange parade&mdash;<br />

<p class="poem">
  "That fine fellow, deep imbibing, with the classic brow and chin,<br />

  On the stage great were his triumphs ere I brought him to disgrace.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He who rends the night with laughter, he with curls of glossy jet,<br />
  Wrote a poem of wondrous beauty, and he reigned a social pet<br />
  Till I touched his vibrant heart-strings with the madness of desire;<br />
  Now he sings no more of beauty, dimmed is his poetic fire.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Now his songs are dark and gloomy, broken are his symphonies,<br />
  And the bright thought halts and falters, glides along,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then stops and flees;<br />
  Now he craves but for my kisses, all his hopes are wrapped in me,<br />

<p class="poem">
  "I have lured the pale religieux from his height of snowy dreams<br />
  By the sweet Circean measures of my strange, soul-haunting themes&mdash;<br />
  Strangled love and filial duty by the witchery of my charms&mdash;<br />
  Quenched the genius of a million, passion-drowned within my arms.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "From his love of virgin beauty, I have led the trusting swain<br />
  Till he sank in my morasses&mdash;till he sought her not again;<br />
  I have watched her fading, drooping like a rose in chilling dawn,<br />
  Waiting for love's warmth that came not, ever paling, sinking wan.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And unto her heart's slow breaking as she guessed her lover's plight,<br />
  I have whispered to her, dreaming of him in the restless night:<br />
  'Maiden, of thy lover dreaming, practising thy girlish arts,<br />
  I could teach thee subtle secrets, philter give that love imparts.<br />

<p class="poem">
  "'But my joy is in the breaking, not the mending of a heart,<br />
  So I'll keep thy truant lover by my wiles from thee apart;<br />

  "'When a wreck he reels through passion, for my charms I'll<br />

  Know, O maiden, this remember, never more shall he be free;<br />
  He, thy lover whom thou dream'st of, yet shall kill for love of me.'<br />

<p class="poem">
  "Thus fair womankind I torture, through that love for man they bear,<br />
  Till from cheeks the roses vanish, till gray-tinged is raven hair;<br />
  While my poison, slowly filtering, stains the fonts of purity,<br />

  "I am Drink, the fiend remorseless, all that's mortal is my prey;<br />

<p class="poem">
  So hell's acolyte satanic, where the tinkling glasses gleamed,<br />

  In the nearing midnight hour on that ribald night of nights.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Told how when, in prisons lonely, men, repenting all too late,<br />

  "Mortal, who in drunken frenzy consummated thy red deed,<br />
  Now awakened and in terror, now, oh, now I take my meed&mdash;<br />
  Satiate my hate with gloating, as remorse shrieks in thy brain,<br />
  When thy bloodshot eyes protruding read thy doom in that red stain!"<br />

<p class="poem">
  Told of bright homes rent and broken, of sweet maidens downward drawn;<br />
  There recited stories sombre of the lives he held in pawn;<br />
  Till the bright lamps dimmed and darkened, till each<br />

<h3>
  THE QUEST ETERNAL<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Ofttimes across the plains of space I gaze,<br />
  When Night holds court amid her jewelled train,<br />
  And where her fairest handmaid beauteous glows,<br />
  I watch to see some signal-fire leap forth<br />
  To tell me if his soul's sojourning there;<br />
  For in his life I've heard him oft propound<br />
  This theory of the purpose of mankind&mdash;<br />
  The age-old mystery of the whirling spheres:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I bathe within the shoreless seas of space&mdash;<br />
  My soul floats o'er the billows fathomless,<br />
  And everywhere the beacon lights gleam clear<br />
  That mark the strands where I shall yet sojourn,<br />
  When finished is my visit on earth's shore;<br />
  For we are all eternal Argonauts<br />
  In hopeful quest of God's own blessed Isle;<br />
  Earth but a port upon the blessed way,<br />
  Where rest we for a space to trim our sails.<br />
  Borne by God's tide, each captain, without chart,<br />
  Must breast the unknown sea by faith sustained,<br />
  And whither bound ask not.  One only knows,<br />
  The Omnipresent Pilot man calls God.<br />
  O soul of mine, yearn not, hope on, nor fear;<br />
  What though the frail-ribbed skiff wherein thou float'st<br />
  Sink in the depths unfathomed?  Thou shalt live,<br />
  And one by one God's infinite islands tread;<br />
  For of His wine immortal thou hast drunk,<br />
  And blest art thou, His pledge upon thy lips;<br />
  Of His red wine enough thy cask contains<br />
  To cheer and nourish till life's sojourn ends.<br />
  And though thine eyes grow dim with watchfulness<br />
  Ere quite the newer harbour breaks to view,<br />
  Thy Pilot's hand shall guide thy tiny bark,<br />
  Nor yet disturb thy dreamless sleep, until<br />
  On glitt'ring sands of some new shore thou'lt wake,<br />
  A little child new-robed and wonder-eyed,<br />
  Gazing enraptured on that newer dream<br />
  Of landscapes rare and shades ineffable,<br />
  With eager steps exploring lovely vales<br />
  'Midst fair companions sweet as earth e'er knew,<br />
  Learning new truths that fancies old dispel,<br />
  And in their contemplation quite forget<br />
  The times unnumbered thou hast lived and loved<br />
  And dreamed fair dreams in other planets old.<br />
  The Father's mansion has full many rooms&mdash;<br />
  Each room a wonder-work, a throbbing star,<br />
  Hung with rare paintings from the Master's brush,<br />
  So wonderful, so mighty in their power,<br />
  That though we ponder them till life's nightfall,<br />
  Our souls scarce grasp the beauty of one scene.<br />
  O thou, who count'st thy crown as nearly won!<br />
  The child grows not o'er-night unto the man.<br />
  How hard the labour of the alphabet!<br />
  How long the contest 'gainst the icy Pole!<br />
  A thousand generations have not solved<br />
  The many secrets of one human frame.<br />
  Why hopest thou then by one life's little span<br />
  To grasp the mystery of a million suns?<br />
  The warring doctors, by their long dispute,<br />
  Their little knowledge prove to humbler men&mdash;<br />
  Each holds the secret of the Only Way,<br />
  Yet each can prove the other's chart is wrong.<br />
  Man in the image of his God was made,<br />
  Mark, then, how man considers earth's dull drones&mdash;<br />
  Will God in courts of Heaven then give place<br />
  That myriads may ever sing His name,<br />
  Sitting with jewelled harps in lazy ease?<br />
  Not so!  God's plan is one of ceaseless aim,<br />
  And He himself unceasingly directs.<br />
  Have we not seen His fiery messengers,<br />
  Hard riding on some planet-rounding course<br />
  Across the ranges of infinity?<br />
  O Argonaut, the journey yet is long,<br />
  And countless worlds are thine yet to explore!<br />
  None know the hour of starting&mdash;then prepare<br />
  And let thy bark clean-decked put out to sea;<br />
  But yesterday a million ships left port,<br />
  But yesterday a million more sailed in;<br />
  Still thou with heart heroic face thy tasks&mdash;<br />
  Faith in thy Pilot keep&mdash;He knows the way&mdash;<br />
  And bravely through the mystery sail on,<br />
  With trust in Him.  'Twill be revealed some day.<br />

  THE BUILDING OF THE CHATEAU

<p class="poem">
  Where the wilderness holds kingdom, where the primal fastness broods,<br />
  I, the rock, within my stratum, lay amid the solitudes,<br />
  Patient lay throughout the ages, part of the primeval plan,<br />
  Till the voice of progress called me to the purpose of the man.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  From afar he came invading, pressing onward unafraid,<br />
  Braved the spirits of the vastness where they met him grim arrayed,<br />
  Piercing past my rugged outposts, hewing down my mighty guards,<br />
  Crying I, the earth god, seeketh, and my purpose none retards.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In the bosom of the mountain, there he found me, laid me bare,<br />
  Found me fitting for his purpose, found me worthy past compare,<br />
  With strange instruments attacked me, drilled and blasted me apart,<br />
  From the wilderness he bore me, from my mountain mother's heart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lifted me with strong devices, dragged me down the mountain trails,<br />
  Barged me down the rushing rivers, speeded me on gleaming rails,<br />
  Captive bore me to the city where I rose above the land,<br />
  For the purpose of the builders who an edifice had planned.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  On the plateau by the river, 'neath the shadow of the tower,<br />
  There the purpose was unfolded of the man's creative power.<br />
  To the northward, the Laurentians purple-tinted cast their haze,<br />
  Such the setting of my future, such the vista for my gaze.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Came the toilers, swiftly shaping, blasting, through the day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and night.<br />
  Delving for my deep foundation by the city's vista'd site,<br />
  Came the long and slender girders all the iron, measured, bored,<br />
  Clanging protest as they piled it, while the blasting ripped<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and roared.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Circling swung the straining derricks, shrieked the engine's<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shrilly note,<br />
  As by magic to their places joint and girder seemed to float;<br />
  Stone on stone they laid and set me, tier on tier my structure rose,<br />
  On the plateau by the river, sweeping seaward as it flows.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They have hewn me to being, they have shaped with skilful hands,<br />
  And the chateau on the plateau o'er the river proudly stands,<br />
  Deemed a miracle of beauty, classic, stately, and refined,<br />
  Reared as fitting habitation for the leaders of mankind.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Though I stand a thing of grandeur, stone on stone majestic piled,<br />
  I am brooding on the open, I am dreaming of the wild.<br />
  They would tame me with their graces, they would lure me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their songs,<br />
  From the olden memoried places where my stony heart belongs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Though the wealthy loll within me and on luxury they feast,<br />
  Though they robe me and bedeck me with the weavings of the East,<br />
  Though my floors with rugs be matted, that their feet may<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silent tread,<br />
  I am steel and stone and iron, and my soul is mountain-bred.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When the wind drives from the mountain far beyond the river shore,<br />
  All my being throbs in gladness to the music of its roar,<br />
  All the primal that's within me, all the hewn and chiselled stone,<br />
  Thrills in greeting to the booming of its mighty chested tone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And I see the pine-tressed mountains where they taunt the raging gale,<br />
  As it roars adown the gulches to the cities of the vale,<br />
  And the bed within its shadows where for centuries I lay,<br />
  Beckons for the lost one, dwelling where the humans hold their sway.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When the night her mask of sable presses on the earth's warm face,<br />
  And when, satined and bejewelled, lovely women do me grace,<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  I the chateau, I the splendid, shall I crumble and decay,<br />
  Lichened guard the shining river when the years have passed away,<br />
  Or a comforter still flourish, guarding humans from the blast,<br />
  When a century has rounded, when a hundred years have passed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Time the jester, time the judger, time the measurer of things,<br />

<h3>
  THE CHOSEN PEOPLE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Somewhere in the Book 'tis written how God had a chosen race,<br />
  One he favoured, while the others could not get to see His face,<br />
  Not a smile of recognition, nor a momentary look,<br />
  And 'twas taken for the gospel, for 'twas written in the Book.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It's been thundered down the ages how Jehovah, in His wrath,<br />
  Swept His wayward, helpless children from the favoured people's path,<br />
  With the whirlwinds of His power, unto woeful death and flame,<br />
  That some despot might keep reigning, razing cities in his name.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Some have pondered as they heard it, and have wondered as they read,<br />
  If the language of the big Book told the truth in all it said;<br />
  For their souls have heard strange music, and their eyes have<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen a light,<br />
  And somehow His chosen people seems the whole world, black and white.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All the globe, with all its peoples, all its races, all its creeds,<br />
  With its wise and unwise sinners, and its strange and varied breeds;<br />
  For the sunlight tells the story, and the rain reveals the truth,<br />
  That our Father's universal, as He was in days of Ruth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not a God of wrath and battles to a chosen few confined,<br />
  But a Father omnipresent, taking care of all mankind;<br />
  And the Deity they worship, and the God to whom they pray,<br />
  Never slaughtered His poor children in the way some chapters say.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Have you seen the sunlight gleaming on a summer day in June,<br />
  Spreading broadcast texts of glory, while the birds hozannas tune?<br />
  How it floods the heart with gladness, and what charity it brings,<br />
  'Till all hate melts to forgiveness in the greater good of things.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Have you seen it kiss the foreheads of the mourners as they weep?<br />
  Have you watched it bathe the outcast as he lays forlorn asleep?<br />
  O, the blessed sun from Heaven shines alike on bad and good;<br />
  Read the lesson of the sunshine, then will He be understood.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Have you seen the falling raindrops, like a blessing glad and sweet,<br />
  On the rock and on the meadow, on the thistle and the wheat?<br />
  What a sermon's in the downpour falling out of God's own hand!<br />
  Read the lesson of the rainfall, as it nourishes the land.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Maybe they're not strong on logic, maybe they have much to learn,<br />
  But it seems if Love created, Hate cannot creation spurn;<br />
  And the rain like benediction and the sunshine glad and bright,<br />
  Fills them with a hope unbounded and a faith that all is right.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Through vicissitude and conflict, as this old world wheels and turns,<br />
  Ever searching, tearful, calling, man for his Creator yearns;<br />
  And I know the Father's watching with a love so great and wide<br />
  That He never could be happy with a pleading soul outside.<br />

  Dark-orbed dear little miss,<br />

  Bagged and thin that you wear;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How you live nobody knows.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Strange little waif of the slums,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrifty and business-like, too,<br />
  Plying your trade with the rest<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  Rushing about in the throng,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling your wares in the cold;<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  Brave little buffeted ship,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battered and blown in life's gale,<br />
  Where is your port in the storm?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what refuge do you sail?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Born of some drab of the street<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down where the red beacons burn,<br />
  May God guide ever your way&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free from sin's shoals may you turn.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Where do you live&mdash;'neath the street,<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  Some pass who turn a deaf ear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your shrill voice when you call;<br />
  But there's One hears, never fear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose love is greater than all.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He alone hears your low sob,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely at night in your bed,<br />
  With none to kiss you to sleep<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or smooth the curls of your head.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sometimes in dreams do you see<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visions of dainties high piled?<br />
  Sometime may that dream be true,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired-out, motherless child.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O mothers, kissing to rest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praying to God o'er your dears,<br />
  Pray for these waifs of the world,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmothered in their young years.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Pray, too, that on that dread day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When judgments fall on earth's sons,<br />
  Censure-free we then may stand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncharged by these little ones.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When for deeds done in the flesh<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each soul its place is assigned,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of being cold or unkind.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  One passed you last night at dusk,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One whom the world brands with shame;<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, who knows, may not so blame.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Once as this child of the street<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She strove for bread, pure of heart,<br />
  Till hope died in her young breast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When mankind failed in its part.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And now if sinning she goes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting her battle alone,<br />

  Dark is the world with its griefs,<br />

  IN SUMMER

<p class="poem">
  In summer, when the rising sun with keen and flashing ray,<br />
  Flings arrows at retreating night, and ushers in the day,<br />
  When out from every nook and glade the frightened shadows creep,<br />
  And scamper off to caverns dark, when life awakes from sleep.<br />
  The gentle sunbeams, kiss the dewy teardrops of the night<br />
  From off the eyelids of the flowers, with whisp'ring soft and light,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then stirs my heart, with yearnings sweet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is thrilled as from above,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of you, of you, my love.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In summer, when the fragrant earth basks in the shimmering glare<br />
  Of noontide warmth, and drowsy hum of insects fills the air,<br />
  When bashful flowers their glories hide amid the grasses tall,<br />
  And nature her siesta takes in hushed and langorous thrall,<br />
  When sparkling streamlets through the dells and o'er the mosses croon,<br />
  And birds and breezes fold their wings within the arms of June,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then stirs my heart, with yearnings sweet<br />

  In summer, when the last faint rays from western sky has fled,<br />

  When shining morn and burning day within the night's cool arms,<br />
  Rest from the pageant of the day, forgetful of their charms,<br />

  She stood in maiden loveliness serene,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fawn-like grace, and beauty rare of face,<br />
  Fair prey I deemed, for I had but to lean<br />

<p class="poem">
  And yet I paused, I hardly knew the why,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said she, as the others, is fair game;<br />
  No guardian stood above her but the sky,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Her pure eyes fronted mine so unafraid,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in their depths dwelt such a wondrous charm,<br />

  And somehow there the evil in me died,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in a dream afraid I seemed to stand,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Days passed, once more beneath the sky,<br />

  "How beautiful the bird's song is!" she said,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lo, the singing came surpassing sweet,<br />

  The breezes soft their peaceful preludes played<br />

  That flowers hearts with drops of wondrous dew<br />
  On gale-swept shores, as where the roses dream?<br />

<h3>
  HEART'S DESIRE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Give me the breath of dewy morns,<br />
  The stirring chase, the hunter's horns,<br />
  The scent of roses 'mid the thorns<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all their beauty dreaming.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give me the shining fields so sweet,<br />
  Where sun and shadow love to meet;<br />
  The sickles swinging through the wheat,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While golden sunlight's streaming.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give me the flower-jewelled hills&mdash;<br />
  A love-song that with rapture thrills,<br />
  That lifts the heart above earth's ills,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gives to life new meaning.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give me the hush of quiet eves,<br />
  The sleepy note amid the leaves,<br />
  God's calm, sweet slumber that relieves,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While starry lamps are gleaming.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give me a woman sweet and true<br />
  To have and hold life's journey through,<br />
  And love like sunshine ever new<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bright eyes softly beaming.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give these, the world may have the rest;<br />
  The heart's content the heart that's blest;<br />
  Ah, gold is bright, but these are best!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll ask no more, I'm deeming.<br />

<h3>
  THE AWAKENING<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Think not 'tis death because so cold earth lies,<br />
  Wrapped in her snowy shroud of billowed white,<br />
  For when the tears of springtime kiss her brow<br />
  Her violet eyes will open wide and sweet,<br />
  And unseen hands will robe her wondrously,<br />
  Weaving with garlands all her tresses fair.<br />
  Again her cheek with blushing rose will glow,<br />
  And sighs sweet-scented will her bosom stir,<br />
  And radiant in her sunny maidenhood,<br />
  With ripples of sweet laughter she will roam,<br />
  Scattering auroral gifts of flow'ry bloom,<br />
  Till all mankind shall worship at her feet.<br />

<h3>
  EYES OF THE HEART<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I haunt again those unforgotten ways<br />
  Where once we walked in dear remembered days;<br />
  And throbbing earth, the streams and skies so blue,<br />
  Call with my heart in longing, dear, for you.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I see thee sad with every wind that grieves,<br />
  Behold thy cheeks in autumn's blushing leaves;<br />
  Thy laugh I hear when come the rippling rills,<br />
  Sparkling and gay adown the grassy hills.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah, it is love that sees alone thy form<br />
  In every rose that doth the vale adorn!<br />
  Ah, it is love when all the summer sky<br />
  Seems but reflected beauty from thine eye!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I hear thy voice in cadences so sweet,<br />
  When birds that love in woody places meet;<br />
  Thy loving smile I see revealed again<br />
  In every sunburst following the rain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When o'er the land soft steals the breath of June,<br />
  And happy birds within the treetops tune,<br />
  Then hand-in-hand again to love's sweet lays<br />
  I walk with thee as in the olden days.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The strands of gold, the sun-god's gleaming hair,<br />
  Is as the light within thy tresses rare;<br />
  The white-sailed moon-ship gliding on the night<br />
  Has gleaned her beauty from thy forehead white.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But food of dreams love cannot satisfy,<br />
  Nor mem'ries feed the starving heart; thus I,<br />
  Love-lorn, with weary wings toward heaven soar,<br />
  Beating for entrance 'gainst God's golden door.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Longing for thee, earth's ways in dreams I tread,<br />
  By thy white hand along its pathways led.<br />
  Counting the hours till on celestial strands<br />
  I'll kiss again thy lips, thine eyes, thy hands.<br />

  CUPID'S ARROW<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, have you met her?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't forget her,<br />
  Fair as the lily, her name;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She with the eyes blue,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of summer sides' hue,<br />
  With her the world I would gain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas on a May day&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, such a gay day!<br />
  Sweet singing birds filled the trees;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Spring went laughing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the gay chaffing<br />
  Of her wayward love, the breeze.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, was merry,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart light and airy,<br />
  Knew not I'd lose it that day;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cupid was stirring,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arrow whirring,<br />
  And my poor heart in the way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled so naively,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glanced I so bravely,<br />
  Unthinking quite of the cost;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that spring morning,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Done without warning,<br />
  I and my poor heart were lost.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas a sweet losing;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I the choosing,<br />
  Gladly again she might take;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I love dearest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I hold nearest,<br />
  Little would be for her sake.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet is the gladness<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled with sadness.<br />
  Did she but smile to betray?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loving, I'm hoping,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In darkness groping,<br />
  Waiting her love to bring day.<br />

  MY APRIL MAIDEN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Maid of moods like April ranging;<br />
  Tearful, then to laughter changing:<br />
  Luring sweetly, then estranging;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have wondered if thou art<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Just a playful nymph coquetting<br />
  With poor mortals, and forgetting<br />
  How thou woundest, nor regretting<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou didst their wounds impart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By thy body shapely, slender,<br />
  By thy glances languid, tender,<br />
  Thou hast made me thy defender,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast nestled in my heart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By thy cheeks as rose-leaves tinted,<br />
  By thy hair from sunbeams minted,<br />
  Thou hast taken love unstinted,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robbed me quite without return.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Each new mood but makes thee dearer,<br />
  Makes my passion stronger, clearer,<br />
  Makes me long to come the nearer,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes me love thee more and more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When I see thine eyes compelling,<br />
  Dark with passion and rebelling<br />
  To thy bosom's quickened swelling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I would thy love implore.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Or when from thy window glancing,<br />
  Bright they shine with laughter dancing,<br />
  They but make thee more entrancing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that could be, than before.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O thou April maiden, weaving<br />
  Spells alluring and deceiving,<br />
  Wilt thou some day me be leaving?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt thou yet my true love spurn!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I have loved thee fondly, madly,<br />
  I would win thee, wed thee gladly,<br />
  In thy snare I'm tangled sadly,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis thy love must set me free.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I have loved thee unabated<br />
  From a time now long undated;<br />
  In a desert land I've waited,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou must my oasis be.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give me love, for time is pressing,<br />
  Doubt's red sands grow hot, distressing;<br />
  Send thy love's rain, sweet caressing;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is none can save but thee.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Dear, the sands are round me burning,<br />
  Thus to thee, sweetheart, I'm turning;<br />
  For thy saving love I'm yearning,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say thou lov'st me, or I burn.<br />

<h3>
  THE CALL OF THE OPEN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I turn my face from the city, the City of Siren Songs,<br />
  I am going back to the prairie to where my heart belongs;<br />
  Her smile is true and gentle, there is peace in her ample breast,<br />
  And I know there's a welcome waiting with my love of the golden West.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It is years since I watched the shadows across her bosom roll,<br />
  Ere the luring voice of the city my boyish senses stole;<br />
  It is long since with swelling bosom I watched the sunbeams glide<br />
  Or the waving, far-flung reaches of her hills and valleys wide.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I am done with the sham and glitter where the huddled millions toil,<br />
  Lured with the money mirage, 'mid the din and the mad turmoil;<br />
  I am sick of the man-made temples that gloss the reeking sod,<br />
  So I take my course to the open, to the glorious temples of God.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I hear the voice of the mountains, they are singing the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oldtime strains,<br />
  The lure of the land is o'er me, the lure of the virgin plains;<br />
  The voice of rivers murmur, "Come back to your boyhood home",<br />
  So I turn my face from the city, I am going back to my own.<br />

<p class="t3">
  PRESENTED TO MY FATHER, ON THE OCCASION OF THE<br />
  CELEBRATION OF HIS EIGHTIETH CHRISTMAS, 1914<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Born of the noblest impulse of the heart,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love comes with joy to worship at a shrine,<br />
  Seeking the dear one, yearning to impart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A benediction drawn from wells divine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So with a heartfelt tribute to your worth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We gather round you in your life's decline,<br />
  To honour you, the author of our birth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ask a blessing on our lives and thine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Rich is your life with honest effort filled,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though your path with trials was beset,<br />
  You bravely fought and counselled and instilled<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noblest, and our hearts do not forget.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It is not wealth that marks life's crowning goal,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor power and place, nor tawdry pomp and fame;<br />
  But worth and true nobility of soul,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-robed years, the fair, untarnished name.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  This is your priceless heritage, we hold,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May we bequeath it thus from sire to son,<br />
  Down generations, while the years unfold;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is your children's wish, their prayer, each one,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And from this loving cup may ever flow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vintage of our hearts, a glowing stream,<br />
  Winding beside you, singing soft and low<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tender memories, with love adream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We pledge you in its bowl with gladsome song,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toast the happiness of days to be.<br />
  May life be joyous, and your years be long,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every hour from care and ills be free.<br />

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
